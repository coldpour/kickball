# Playing the Field (Defense)

When your team is on defense, it's called, "playing the field." You will either be an infielder or an outfielder. You need to keep in mind how many outs there are and where the force is in order to make the best decision about where and how to make the play and keep the offense from gaining extra bases and scoring runs.

## First Base

There is always a force to first, so you need to be ready, for a throw from anywhere. Stand a few steps behind and to the right of the base so that you can cover more space in the infield. If the ball is hit to you or down the first base line, concentrate on fielding it, don't worry about running to the base. Let the pitcher run to the base for you and just toss them the ball. If there's a runner already on first, and the ball gets kicked to you, you may want to throw it to second instead of to the pitcher covering first to prevent the runners advancing to around the bases. Finally, if there's a pop fly, even if its going foul, go catch it for an out!

## Second Base & Shortstop

You two are going to be covering second base together. Stand a step or two closer to second base than the midpoint of the baseline and a few steps back toward the outfield. That way the ball will be in front of you as long as possible and you can still cover the bag. Know where the force is and if the ball comes to you, where you're going to throw it. When there are no runners on yet, the force is to first, if you get the ball, throw it to first. If it doesn't come to you, go cover second in case of an overthrow at first, you can be the target for the first baseman that holds the runner at second. When there's a runner on first, the force is to second. If the ball comes to you, the other one of you will cover second so toss it to them for an easy out. If the ball goes deep into your side of the outfield, you can take a few steps into the outfield and become the cutoff. The cutoff makes it so that the outfielder has a shorter throw and then you complete the play wherever there's a force or a runner off a bag. If the ball goes anywhere else, cover second and get ready to catch a throw and make a play.

## Third Base

You are the target for most kickballers looking to get on first base. You also have the farthest throw to first. It's important that you don't miss when throwing, to first especially, so that the runner doesn't get extra bases. If you can't accurately throw all the way to first, throw it to the pitcher on the mound as soon as possible to stop the play. When there is a runner on first, the force is to second, so don't worry about throwing to first, if you get the ball, throw it to second. When there's a runner on first and second, the force is to third. If the ball comes to you, field it and let the shortstop cover the base, so you can toss it to them. When there's a runner on second but no one on first, they don't have to run to third. There's no force, but they can run if they want to. When there's no force, you need to tag the runner or peg them with the ball. If you are going to peg, don't miss or they will get extra bases and may even get home! If there's a fly ball, even if its going foul, go catch it for an out! Then make a play based on the force and who forgot to tag up.

## Pitcher

You have to pitch from behind the rubber on the mound. You can roll it as fast as you want. You can bounce the pitch a bit to make the kick more difficult, but not too much. A pitch within one fool of the plate is a strike. Outside that is a ball. Once it's kicked, you are still part of the play. And the play ends with you. It's only over once you have the ball on the mound. If you have the ball and you're walking around second base, they can keep running and scoring. However, there are some really smart times to leave the mound. If the ball gets hit to first, go put your foot on first as quickly as possible and get ready for the first baseman to toss you the ball. Same thing if there is a force at third and the ball gets kicked to third, sprint to third and make the play. If there's a bunt, you or the catcher field the ball. Communicate and say, I got it. Then throw to the forced base.

## Catcher

You have to stay behind the kicker until they've kicked the ball, but you can run up behind them so you can field the ball faster in case they bunt. If they kick it straight up in the air, you can catch the ball for an out, even if its going foul. The ball is foul if it crosses one of the baselines before it gets past either first or third base. It's also foul if it doesn't make it past that arc in front of home plate. The ball can land in the infield and then roll foul due to spin, so be on the lookout for that.

## Outfield

Catch fly balls and know where you're going to throw it if it comes to you. Figure this out before its kicked based on the force. You need to field the ball as quickly as possible and get it back to the infield so we can get runners out. Don't let the ball get past you. Use your body to stop a bouncing ground ball if you're not sure you can field it cleanly. If you can't throw accurately all the way to the forced base, either the second baseman or the shortstop should be a few steps in the outfield acting as a cutoff. Get them the ball as quickly as possible so that they can make a play.

# At Bat (Offense)

When your team is on offense, it's called being, "at bat." You will either be kicking, running the bases, yelling from the dugout, or helping runners decide what to do as first/third base coach.

## Kicking

When you're the kicker, your primary goal is to get on base. Your secondary goal is to kick the ball to a place that will help your teammates who are runners advance around the bases without getting out.

### Strikes, Balls, and Fouls

You have to be behind home plate when you kick the ball. If the pitch is within a foot of the plate, it's a strike whether you swing or not. If it's farther than a foot from the plate, then it's a ball. The ump is there to decide what's what and has the final say. Don't ever argue with the ump. 4 balls is a walk and you get a free trip to first base. Check with the ump on your first at bat to find out if we're playing 3 or 4 strikes. We've done both so far this year. If you kick the ball and it goes foul, that counts as a strike, even if it's your last strike. The ball is foul if it crosses one of the baselines before getting past first/third base. Once it's past first/third, if it rolls/bounces across the baseline, it's still fair. The ball also has to stay beyond the arc in front of home plate, if it rolls back over that arc after you kick it, it's foul.

### Where to Aim your Kick

The easiest way to get on first base is to kick the ball down the third base line because most people can not throw all the way to first, or if they can, they cannot do it accurately. If we have a runner on second and there's a force to third, you might not want to kick it to third, since they will get out easily. If you have enough control on the ball when you kick, you might want to pick out someone that looks like a weak infielder and aim for them. Otherwise, you may want to try bunting so that your teammate can get to third and into scoring position. A bunt is a soft kick that makes it past the arc and stays inside the baselines. Sometimes, you don't even have to kick to bunt successfully, you may just be able to let the ball bounce off your foot. You can try to bunt down the first base line or down the thrid base line. It's probably best to not bunt straight at the pitcher since they will just throw you out.

### Kicking Technique

You will get a surprising ammount of power by kicking the ball with your toe. Don't do that in soccer, but in kickball, it's quite effective. To get more control over the direction of the ball, try using the side of your foot perpendicular to the path you want the ball to take. If you connect with your instep and follow through, you can place the ball down the third base line pretty consistently. This will be less powerful than using your toe, but sometimes the additional control is worth it. To bunt, let the ball roll into the side of your foot without swinging. Whether kicking or bunting, the further you strike the ball below the center, the more air you will get. To keep the ball low, try to strike the ball just above center. It's easiest to keep a ball on the ground if the pitch is not bouncy. So you may want to let the first couple bouncy ones go by, or ask the pitcher to roll it better. If all you're getting is bouncy pitches, you may want to just kick the ball as hard as you can with your toe and hope for the best. If you want to kick the ball hard and keep it low, to the ground, point your toe towards the ground and hit the ball with your laces like a soccer player. This kick is difficult to pull off with a soccer ball and even harder with a kickball. So if you haven't practiced it before, you might want to choose a different kick while you work on this one.  

## Running the bases

On offense, it's important to keep track of how many outs there are and whether or not there is a force to a certain base since those two things will help you determine whether to run or stay on a given play.

### As the Kicker

Once you kick, run as fast as possible to first. Don't worry if you lose sight of the ball. Put your head down and run hard. Listen for your teammate playing first base coach to tell you whether to round for second or stay on first. If it's going to be close, you can run through first. As long as you touch first before the defense can make a play, and then stay outside the baseline, you are safe. You cannot overrun any other base. When running to second or third, make sure to stay on the bag once you get there. If you overrun the base, they can get you out. So either stop squarely at second, or round second, making sure to touch the bag, and get to third as quickly as possible.

### Pop Flys and Tagging Up

When you're on base and there are fewer than two outs, you have to be extra careful when running the bases. If there's a pop fly, and it's caught, you need to tag the base you were on before going to the next base. That's called, "tagging up," and if you don't do it, they can throw the ball to the base you left and get you out. On the other hand, if the pop fly is dropped, you don't need to tag up before running to the next base. So commonly, runners will take a step or two off the base when the ball is kicked, so that they're closer to the next base in case it's dropped, and only go back if the ball is caught. Another strategy is to stay on the base when the ball is kicked until it's caught so that you don't need to waste time going back to the base to tag up and you can just sprint to the next base. Whatever strategy you decide, make sure that any runners in front of you are also going to tag up and advance once the ball is caught, otherwise, you might be leaving your safe base and end up in a pickle. Now, when there are two outs already, if the fly ball is caught, the inning will be over anyway. So as a runner, if there are two outs, you should run as fast as you can to the next base and assume that the fly will be dropped.

### Force

If all the bases behind you have runners on them, then you are a forced runner. And in order for everyone behind you to get on base safely, you have to advance to the next base. When you're on first, you are always a forced runner since the kicker will be trying to run to first once they kick. However, if they kick a pop fly, and it's caught, there is no longer a force and you can stay on your base if running to the next base would put you in danger of getting out. When you're on second, you are forced if there is a runner on first, since they are also forced. If there's no runner on first, then you can choose to run to third or stay on second if there's a danger of getting out. When you're on third, you are only forced if there are also runners on both first and second. If there's no runner on second, or first, or both, then you also get to choose whether or not to run or stay safe on the base. When there's not a force to your base, other runners behind you can't advance if you choose to stay on your base. If you can communicate to your teammate about whether or not you're running, that can be helpful, but it's really their responsibility to know that they base they're going to is/will be clear before they try to advance. If you're not forced, the fielders cannot get you out by tagging a base. They need to either tag you or peg you with the ball to get you out. This gives you additional freedom to chose to run or not run and gets more exciting since people may be chasing you or trying to throw balls at you. Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

### From First

When you're on first, the kicker is forcing you to second. If the ball is kicked on the ground, you have to run to second. If it's kicked far, you might have time to run to third or even home. Listen to your third base to decide. However, if there's a pop fly, and it's caught, you need to tag up and then decide whether you are safe to take second. If the ball was caught in the infield, you probably want to stay. If it's in the outfield and you can reach second before they can throw it there, go for it, and sprint!

### From Second

If you're on second and there is a runner on first, you are forced and you must run unless it's a pop fly. If there's no runner on first, there is no force, so when the ball is kicked, you don't have to run to third if it's not safe. If there's no force, the fielders will likely focus on getting the ball to first where there is a force and leave you to run the rest of the bases. Just make sure that they've already thrown the ball away from second and third, because they can still tag/peg you and they will if you make it easy for them to do.

### From Third

If you're on third and there is no runner on second, you are not forced to run home. If the ball gets kicked toward third base, or the shortstop, wait til they throw the ball to first before you run to third. Listen for your teammate playing third base coach for when to run and whether to stay at third or round the base and run home. If you're forced, the defense may try to make a play at home and all they need to do is touch home plate with the ball in hand. So if you're forced and there's no pop fly, get home as quickly as possible!
